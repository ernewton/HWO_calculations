Eric Nielsen slack message (June 4 2024):

So I like this example, and we can probably make it a little more quantitative: 
with what significance are oxygen-detected planets older than non-oxygen-detected planets? 
We can use an equation from the 2019 GPIES midcourse stats paper: (eq 9 of Nielsen+ 2019)

TODO:

- assume percentage uncertainty on age rather than absolute number (10-20% from astroseismo)
- constrain lower limit on oxygen onset time assuming oxygen never appears
- constrain oxygen duration rather than oxygen onset time
